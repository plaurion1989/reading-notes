* Who is Roy Fielding?

- with his friends, he wrote the first server that sent documents through the internet

- because we currently are only able to talk to a small group of machines instead of machines as a whole

* What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

* What does a GET do? 

- gets data from the machine

* What does a POST do?

- adds data to a machine
