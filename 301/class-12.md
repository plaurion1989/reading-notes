# MongoDB and Mongoose
### Five differences between SQL and NoSQL

SQL | NoSQL 
-----|------
Table based database | Document based database
SQL have predefined schemas | Databases are the collectrion of things that do no have schema definitions
SQL databases are vertically scalable | NoSQL is horizontally scalable
Structured Query Language | Unstructured Query Language
Relational Database | Non-relational database 

* What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

sites generating high query or transaction traffic.

**Give a real world example**

amazon maybe, unless they have their own design.

* What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

graph data, key-value data, xml databases.

**Give a real world example**

some kind of scientific research platform shared only among knowlegable collegues as a means to access raw data.

* Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL 

* Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL because you can just keep adding servers, while with sql you will have to do more work to make it as scalable.

* What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language.

* What is a relational database?

a database that stores data in a structured format with rows and columns.

* What type of structure does a relational database work with?

organized in tables with rows and columns.

* What is a schema?

a collection of data or schema objects.

* What is a NoSQL database?

It's a database structure that is more dynamic than SQL.

* How does it work?

you need to define your data structure prior to use with NoSQL, while SQL has a rigid structure.

* What is inside of a Mongo database?

data records that are stored as documents then are put into a collection.

* Which is more flexible - SQL or Mongo DB? and why.

Mongo DB is scalable as a NoSQL,  while SQL is not as scalable and has a ridgid structure.

* What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

it takes longer to use initially because you have to build out the structure before using it.
