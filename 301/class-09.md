# Functional Programming

## What Is Functional Programming?

Developing software through pure functions, and less shared state and mutable data. 

* What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

sends input and returns the same value as output. if it doesnt return the same output, that might be a good indication that it isnt pure.

* What are the benefits of a pure function?

no side effects, completely indedependent, stable, consistent and easily tested.

* What is immutability?

objects that can't be modified after its created.

* What is Referential transparency?

not allowing an expression to change.

## Node.js

* What is a module?

a JavaScript file

* What does the word ‘require’ do?

require will read and execute the specified file.

* How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

const variable = require ('./variable.js'); 

* What do we have to do to make a module available?

use the export method.
