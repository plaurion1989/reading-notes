# Mark Down in my own words

## Header's
There are Six different Header sizes, the size of the header is determined by the number of '#'s you use in your markdown.  see Table 1:

Code|Header Size
----|----
'#'|H1 (Largest)
'###'|H3 (Mid Size)
'######'|H6 (Smallest)

## List's

#### Unordered List's
These are written in markdown by using '-' or '*' before each listed statement; example
- this
- is the
- example

#### Ordered List's
These are written in markdown my numbering before each statement by using '1.'
Each numbered item can begin with '1.' and markdown will number them sequentially; example
1. i typed '1.'
1. i typed '1.' again
1. did it again... but my list is still sequential.


## Images
Create an image link by starting with '!', then wrapping the description in brackets '[ ]', and then wrapping the link in parentheses '()'.  an example of the entire markdown line for an image would look like this:
>
*!*
*[See my Picture]*
*(picture.jpeg)*

## Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets '[ ]', and then wrapping the URL in parentheses '()'.  An example of the markdown line for a link would look like this:
>
*[My Favorite Site]*
*(favoritesite.org)*
