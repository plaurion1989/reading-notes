# Book HTML/CSS
## Chapter 4; Links
Links are created by using the `<a>` tag.  you can click on anythng that is written between the opening and closing `<a>` tag.  you specify where you want to link to by using the *href* attribute within the opening tag.

when linking between your own content within your folders, you would use a relative link method.

Relative Link Type | Example
-------------------|----------------
Same Folder | `<a href="example1.html">EXAMPLE1</a>`
Child Folder | `<a href="one/example2.html">EXAMPLE2</a>`
Grandchild Folder | `<a href="one/two/example3.html">EXAMPLE3</a>`
Parent Folder | `<a href="../example4.html">EXAMPLE4</a>`
Grandparent Folder | `<a href="../../example5.html">EXAMPLE5</a>`


## Chapter 15; Layout
This chapter is everything to do with element arrangement and style.
styling they go over include:
1. position:static.  normal flow
1. position:relative. relation to where it would have been in normal.
1. position:absolute.  taken out of normal flow and doesnt affectb other elements position.
1. position:fixed. is a type of absolute position, but fixes element in position regardless of other element positions.

they go on to describe the importance of screen size and creating the styling to fit all screen types in mobile or desktop settings.

# Book Javascript/JQuery
## Chapter 3; Functions, Methods and Objects
I could read this chapter a hundred times and still not fully understand these concepts.  A function lets you group a series of statements together to perform a task as many times as you'd like without having to type out each statement within a function repeatedly.  you could have a long sequence that performs as a function, but as long as the function exists, all you would need to do in order to perform that function would be to call the function in your code.  example `basicFunction();` is all you would need to type in your code after you established the function.

# Article; 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
Two coders work together at a single work station, one is the navigator and one is the driver.  The Navigator uses words to navigate and keeps eyes on the big picture, also doesnt provide any direct input to the computer.  the Driver does all of the computer input work.

There are four main skills that help coders learn
1. listening
1. speaking
1. reading
1. writing
Paired programing does all of those things, there by helping each coder learn and absorb during the process.

>There are 6 other factors to promote pair programming.

1. Greater Efficiency; Research indicates that pair programming takes slightly shorter time and produces higher quality code.

1. Engaged Collaberation; its much harder to procrastinate when someone else is relying on you to complete your work.

1. Learning from fellow students; if one programmer has a unique way to problem solve, the other is exposed to that method and vice versa.

1. Social Skills; its essential to have people on your team that can work well with others.

1. Job interview readiness; for most employers, the ability to collaborate and work well with others is a huge must.

1. Work environment readiness; most companies use this paired programming method in the workplace, given that it has so many benefits.
