# Article; 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
Two coders work together at a single work station, one is the navigator and one is the driver.  The Navigator uses words to navigate and keeps eyes on the big picture, also doesnt provide any direct input to the computer.  the Driver does all of the computer input work.

There are four main skills that help coders learn
1. listening
1. speaking
1. reading
1. writing
Paired programing does all of those things, there by helping each coder learn and absorb during the process.

>There are 6 other factors to promote pair programming.
1. Greater Efficiency; Research indicates that pair programming takes slightly shorter time and produces higher quality code.

1. Engaged Collaberation; its much harder to procrastinate when someone else is relying on you to complete your work.

1. Learning from fellow students; if one programmer has a unique way to problem solve, the other is exposed to that method and vice versa.

1. Social Skills; its essential to have people on your team that can work well with others.

1. Job interview readiness; for most employers, the ability to collaborate and work well with others is a huge must.

1. Work environment readiness; most companies use this paired programming method in the workplace, given that it has so many benefits.
