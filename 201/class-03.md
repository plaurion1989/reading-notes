## Chapter 3; Lists
HTML has three types of lists:
1. Ordered Lists, listed out alpha/numeric in nature usualy. 
1. Unordered Lists, that lead off wit bullet point and have no set start point or sequence to them.
1. Definition list, set of terms along with definitions for those terms.

> this is a very short and very basic chapter.
## Chapter 13; Boxes
Every element is a box, so long as there is a tag in html, your css will have the capacity to manipulate the appearance and divide that material as you see fit.  

you can limit the width, height, set overflow content within a box to have its own scrollbar or simply hide that content all together.  

### Boarder, Margin and Padding
#### Boarder
Every box has a boarder, regardless if it is visible or not. Adjusting boarder width is just making the boarder visible in whatever direction you are chosing to thicken the boarder.  

There are many different styles of boarders, so dont be afraid to play around and see what you like:
- Solid
- Dotted
- Dashed
- Double
- Groove
- Ridge
- Inset
- Outset

you can style or thicken any side of the boarder, and you can even round them out as well by adjusting the boarder-radius:  making a boarder into a full circle is even a fun possibility!

## Chapter 4; Decisions and Loops
### IF ... ELSE statement
> The `IF` is used to determine if a condition is true or truthy While the `ELSE` or `ELSE IF` statements are used when it is not.

Use of the IF statement is to evaluate conditions set either by the value of a variable in relation to the IF statement, or in relation to all variables within a function, so long as they are called within the if statement.  same goes for else if.  that statement might be confusing, but i understand it when i say it that way.  even if theyre is more to it than what i mentioned.
