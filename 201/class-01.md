## HTML Reading by Chapter
### Chapter 1, Structure
> In this Chapter the author compared the use of HTML structure with that of a News Paper.  Each facet of the page is framed to help the viewers understand the message that your page is trying to convey.

#### HTML Describes the Structure

> Using Elements or Tags, HTML has a variety of framing tools to help the author design the framework of the web page while knowing exactly where and how the project is going to turn out.

 - `<HTML>` is used to indicate that everything written within this tag is comprised of HTML code, anything after this tag `</HTML>` is not considered apart of the structure of the site.
 - Anything between the `<body>`,`</body>` tags is content that is to be shown on the main site.
 - There are multitudes of these tags or elements that are used as buckets for information to be structured within the `<HTML>` tag to be used at will in sequence by the architect of the site.

### Chapter 8, Extra Markup

 > There have been **Several** different versions of HTML since tis inception.  Just to mention a few versions; HTML4, XHTML 1.0 and HTML5 in current use today.

 > Because there have been several different types of HTML, it is *ESSENTIAL* that authors of these webpages specify what version of HTML they are using.  Thats where the **DOCTYPE** declaration comes in.  This tells the web browser what type of HTML code you are using in your text document.

#### A Few Tags I Learned

 ***`<meta>`*** is used to tell the browser what your web page is about before the *`<head>`* tag.

 ***`<!--""-->`*** is a tag that allows the author to leave notes out of view from the content within the page.

 ***`<iframe>`*** Is like a little window cut out of your page that allows you to view another page.  the term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.

### Chapter 17, HTML5 Layout

 > The utilization of the `<div>` tag has been dramatically reduced, if not completely eliminated by most authors using HTML5 because of the new set of *Elements* of *Tags* that HTML5 provides in lue of using the afformentioned tag to divide up the parts of a page.
 - `<header>`
 - `<nav>`
 - `<article>`
 - `<aside>`

 > However, the `<div>` element is still going to be important in grouping together related elements.

 * The chapter goes on about the various new elements and their function.

### Chapter 18, Process and Design

 > This chapter is written to help an author find their target audience and relate the information your page displays to maintain viewership.  

 > It also explains how using relivent data on demographics will help you target your desired group, or inclusion of other groups to boost viewership numbers.

#### Wireframing

 > This is a useful tip to authors trying to navigate their design plans.  Allowing them to get an idea of what design flows best with the content that the author is prividing the page for viewer display.

# Book Javascript & JQuery
## Introduction to Javascript
### Chapter 1/A
This chapter explains how javascript is used to make websites more interactive within a browser. there are four basic ways that it acomplishes this feat:
1. Accesses Content from your structure by selecting any element that has a class atribute
2. Modifies Content by adding elements, attributes and text to your page.  Even removing them if you desire.
3. Programming Rules to set step by step instructions for the browser to follow like a recipie, which allows you to access or change content on your webpage.
4. React to Events by creating a specific script that runs when a specific event occurs on your webpage, telling the browser to change or modify content.

#### What is a Script?
A Script is a series of instructions that your computer will follow in order to achieve a goal you want the computer to achieve.
> The chapter reminds the reader that it is important to know that computers take instruction very differently than people do.  while people can assume that other people have some baseline knowledge of the world around them, it is easier to explain how to make a pb&j.  
> If you were to tell a computer how to make a pb&j, it would need to be broken down programmatically in order for the computer to perform the task correctly.  This would have to be performed every time, because no matter how many times a computer makes a pb&j, it will be like making it the first time all over again.

#### Writing a Script
1. Define the task you want to achieve, as if it were a puzzle for the computer to solve for the first time.
2. Design a script that is split up into a series of tasks in order to solve the puzzle.  they recommend that you use a flow chart to structure out your ideas before you begin writing the script.
3. Each step of the way has to be coded in the language that the computer understands.
