# Operators and Loops
## Comparison Operators
> These operators have a result in **Boolean**, meaning true or false.

Operator | Meaning
---------|----------
== | is equal to
=== | is strict equal to
!= | is not equal to
!== | is strict not equal to
\\> | greater than
< | less than
\\>= | greater than or equal to
<= | less than or equal to

> There is usually one operator and two operands, operands are the valuse or variables placed on each side of the operator `3 <= 3` would return true.

## Logic Operators
> These operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.  the best way to really describe it would to show the different logic operators and give an example.

Logic Operator | Meaning | Example
---------------|---------|----------
&& | Logical AND | `((2>6) && (4>=2))` returns true
\\|| | Logical OR | `((2<5) || (2<1))` returns true
! | Logical NOT | `!(2<1)` returns true

## Loops
Loops check a condition, there are three types of loops:
> For; these are the most commonly run loops, they run code a specific number of times.

> While; this should run when you aren's sure how many times the code should run, the code will continue so long as the condition remains *true*.

> Do While; its similar to the while loop, but the difference is that it will run everything inside a statement atleast once, even if the condition turns out to be false.
