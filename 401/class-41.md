## [What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?](https://clearcode.cc/blog/why-developers-contribute-open-source-software/)
`While each person may have different individual motivations, here is a list of some of the most common reasons why developers contribute to open-source software:`
1. Improve Coding Skills:
   * The only real way to get better and prefect your craft is to practice.
   * Learning from feedback from more accomplished programmers.
2. Gain Early Experience
   * Obtain valuable experience necessary for employment.
   * Become better at reading code produced by others, all activities that will happen in the real world on the job.
3. Increase Community and Peer Recognition
   * Getting peer recognition can often lead to additional opportunities in the field.
   * Having a bit of self recognition and accomplishment is a great moral booster as well.
4. Greater Job Prospects
   * When tech companies get an applicant, they spend more time reviewing their GitHub account than they do the piece of paper with your name on it.
   * Prospective employers can assess developer's skill set by looking at the code that you've written.
5. Improve Software on a User and Business level
   * Within every open-source project, the requirements for non-programming skills and contributions are just as necessary.
