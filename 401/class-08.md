# Object Oriented Design
## Rule of Three
Avoiding duplication rule was made popular by ***Martin Fowler***. Three strikes then you refactor, is the code refactoring rule of thumb.  Duplication is bad practice because it makes it difficult to maintain your codebase.
## DRY; Don't Repeat Yourself
Repetition reducing principal that uses data normalization or abstractions to avoid redundancy in your codebase.  the principal was formed by ***Andy Hunt*** and ***Dave Thomas*** (they wrote the book on it, literally).  The gist of it is, if a single element is changed it doesn't require a change to your logic. 
- alternatives methods include:
1. WET
2. AHA
## MVP; Minimum Viable Product
The version of a product that has just enough features to be usable by a customer base that is willing to provide feedback to improve features and add new features in future development.  it exists to avoid unnecessary work before obtaining consumer feedback. the term was defined by ***Frank Robinson***.
## YAGNI; You Aren't Going to Need It
is an extreme programming principal that states a programmer shouldn't add functionality until it is absolutely necessary.  Basically, do the simplest thing that will work for your codebase needs.  written in part by ***Ron Jeffries***.
