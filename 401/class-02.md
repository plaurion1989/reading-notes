# Arrays, Loops, Imports
## Guide to Java Loops
Looping is a feature that executes a set of instructions (code) until it the controlling boolean-expression evaluates to false.

* Simple For Loop allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.
* While Loop repeats a statement while the controlling boolean expression is true.
* Do-While Loop does essentially the same thing that a while loop does, except the first condition is the first iteration of the loop.

## Imports
The first statement in a java source file is the package declaration.  Syntax for the statement order:
1. Package statement(optional)
2. Imports(optional)
3. Class or Interface definitions.
