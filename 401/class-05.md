# Linked Lists
Linked Lists are a sequence of Nodes that are  linked to each other. Each Node in the Linked List reference the next Node in the list.  It has a Linear data structure, as you could probably infer based on the description.  Arrays and Linked lists are a little similar, but a key difference between the two are that Linked lists are more dynamic.

There are two types of Linked lists, Singly linked and Doubly linked.  regardless of the type, every list has a Head(referencing the beginning of the list) a Current(referencing what Node you are currently on) and a Tail(the last Node that then points to NULL).
