# Monetization
### Sell goods and services
Developers that distribute their app using Google Play are required to use their billing system.  Google Play's billing system makes it easy for users to purchase goods and services on your app consistently, securely and seamlessly. Items that are included in the billing system include the following:
- ***Virtual game products***, like coins, extra lives, items or avatars.
- ***App functionality or content***, such as ad-free version of the app or new features not on the free version.
- ***Subscription services***, like social networking services for example.
- ***Cloud software products*** to include data storage services or financial management software to name a couple.

When using Google Play to sell *physical* goods that are used or delivered outside of your app, Google play speeds up the checkout process for users by entering their payment details one time.  Products that developers could use include:
- ***Retail merchandise*** like groceries, clothes, electronics, etc.
- ***Physical services*** to include transportation, cleaning services, food delivery, etc.
- ***One-time membership fees or recurring dues*** such as gym memberships, magazine subscriptions, loyalty programs, etc.
- ***Electronic bill payment*** like credit card bills, utilities and cable services.

##### Other monetization options
Advertising will fund your application for showing `Google AdMob ads`, like native ads that let you match based on your app's look and feel.

Set a price for your app in Google Play, so that individuals have to pay in order to download your app.
