# Object Oriented Programming
## What is an Object

 Real world objects and Objects in programming languages are not very different from each other.  they all have state and behavior.
* State is stored in Fields
* Behavior is stored in Methods

Benifits to OOP include:
1. Modularity
2. Information-hiding
3. Code re-use
4. Pluggability and debugging ease

## What is a Class
Classes are objects that have a collection of methods and fields that are blueprints to creating multitudes of instances.  for example, you might have thousands of cars being created from a Car class.  each individual Car would be an instance of that Car class.  (an object built using that particular set of blueprints)


## Base, Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers
- Base numbers are any number from 0-9.  this is typically called Base-10 because we all learn to count this way from an early age.
- Binary numbers ar Base-2, you start counting at 0 then 1.  Since you're already out of digits, you have to start back again at 0 while increasing the number on the left by 1.
- Hexadecimals have 16 characters, 0-9 and A-F.  Starting at 0 you count up to 9, then transition from 9 to A finishing the progression at F before starting back at 0. once you get to the point of starting back at 0, you must increment the left character once and continue your progression from there.
