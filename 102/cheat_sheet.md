### **Chosing YOUR Favorite Text Editor**
>Being curious about why one text editor was favored over another, I would download each text editor just to be able to compare. I can’t say that I’ve found an absolute favorite yet. But choosing a text editor ends up being a very personal choice, as personal as the sports teams you support.
