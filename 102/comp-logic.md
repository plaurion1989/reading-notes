# Architecture and Logic
## What makes a Computer, a Computer!
There are four things that are common to all computers
1. Input
1. Storage
1. Processing
1. Output

> They started out as basic calculators that were only able to process only basic math while taking forever!

**Input** are the actions that we do that tell the computer to do things in response.

> All of this information is sent to **Storage** and sent to **Processing** through algorythms and sent back to storage.  

>The newly stored data from the processor is then sent through as **Output** to us!

## Binary and Data
Computers work on a series of ones and zeros, these are actually electric signals that represent only two option arguments.  this is called a *BIT*

### Binary number system
You can count to any number using the binary number system.  Unlike the decimal numbers system, Binary works with 1+1=2bits and 2+2=4bits and so on.  so the system has a 1's position, 2's position, 4's position, 8's position and so on.

## Circuts and Logic
In order to process information, a computer needs to modify incoming binary signals. the signal received in a circut is not the signal that comes out.  

There are many complex circuts that can add, multiply and subtract signal to produce various results.

However, even though circuts only conduct simple math, they process billions of calculations in less than a second.
