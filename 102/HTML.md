# HTML Reading by Chapter
## Chapter 1, Structure
> In this Chapter the author compared the use of HTML structure with that of a News Paper.  Each facet of the page is framed to help the viewers understand the message that your page is trying to convey.

#### HTML Describes the Structure

> Using Elements or Tags, HTML has a variety of framing tools to help the author design the framework of the web page while knowing exactly where and how the project is going to turn out.

 - `<HTML>` is used to indicate that everything written within this tag is comprised of HTML code, anything after this tag `</HTML>` is not considered apart of the structure of the site.
 - Anything between the `<body>`,`</body>` tags is content that is to be shown on the main site.
 - There are multitudes of these tags or elements that are used as buckets for information to be structured within the `<HTML>` tag to be used at will in sequence by the architect of the site.

## Chapter 8, Extra Markup

 > There have been **Several** different versions of HTML since tis inception.  Just to mention a few versions; HTML4, XHTML 1.0 and HTML5 in current use today.

 > Because there have been several different types of HTML, it is *ESSENTIAL* that authors of these webpages specify what version of HTML they are using.  Thats where the **DOCTYPE** declaration comes in.  This tells the web browser what type of HTML code you are using in your text document.

### A Few Tags I Learned

 ***`<meta>`*** is used to tell the browser what your web page is about before the *`<head>`* tag.

 ***`<!--""-->`*** is a tag that allows the author to leave notes out of view from the content within the page.

 ***`<iframe>`*** Is like a little window cut out of your page that allows you to view another page.  the term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.

## Chapter 17, HTML5 Layout

 > The utilization of the `<div>` tag has been dramatically reduced, if not completely eliminated by most authors using HTML5 because of the new set of *Elements* of *Tags* that HTML5 provides in lue of using the afformentioned tag to divide up the parts of a page.
 - `<header>`
 - `<nav>`
 - `<article>`
 - `<aside>`

 > However, the `<div>` element is still going to be important in grouping together related elements.

 * The chapter goes on about the various new elements and their function.

## Chapter 18, Process and Design
