### A Growth Mindset in the words of Patrick
***"A growth mindset is understanding through adversity; a constructive way to develop through faliure."***

#### In reminding myself to keep a Growth Mindset, i visualize the Cat!
1. **The cat isn't falling, it's pulling itself up!** _striving to achieve in a failing situation leads to a more productive outlook!_
2. **The cat isn't sad, it's determined!** _feeling sorry for myself instead of tackling something head on is a slippery slope!_
3. **The cat isn't worried, it's excited for the oppourtunity to learn!** _taking every challenge life throws your way as an oppourtunity for growth!_

### About Me

Serving in the US Navy has provided unique insite into team efficiency and effectively working with a sense of urgency.  Having experience working in a diverse work place environment, I understand the value each individual brings to the table and sharing that value builds an even stronger group of people. Since the birth of my second child, I have dedicated myself to the persuit of a better career.  Inspired by many other Code Fellows graduates, I finally took the initiative to better myself through education.
