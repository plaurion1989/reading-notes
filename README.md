### A Growth Mindset in the words of Patrick
***"A growth mindset is understanding through adversity; a constructive way to develop through faliure."***

#### In reminding myself to keep a Growth Mindset, i visualize the Cat!
1. **The cat isn't falling, it's pulling itself up!** _striving to achieve in a failing situation leads to a more productive outlook!_
2. **The cat isn't sad, it's determined!** _feeling sorry for myself instead of tackling something head on is a slippery slope!_
3. **The cat isn't worried, it's excited for the oppourtunity to learn!** _taking every challenge life throws your way as an oppourtunity for growth!_

### About Me
My name is Patrick, after many different career attempts i had finally decided to move in the direction of coding.  Currently, the track I am on is the Python 401 night course.  Focusing on my work life balance is something i have been neglecting in past years.  Since the birth of my second child, taking a new direction in life has taken priority.  A friend of mine completed these courses and is doing extreemely well in the field.  Inspired by many others after several years of hearing about Codefellows, I finally took the initiative to better myself and better my career!
