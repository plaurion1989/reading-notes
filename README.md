## Welcome to Patricks 102 Reading Notes
### A Growth Mindset in the words of Patrick
***"A growth mindset is understanding through adversity; a constructive way to develop through faliure."***

#### In reminding myself to keep a Growth Mindset, i visualize the Cat!
1. *The cat isn't falling, it's pulling itself up!* _striving to achieve in a failing situation leads to a more productive outlook!_
2. *The cat isn't sad, it's determined!* _feeling sorry for myself instead of tackling something head on is a slippery slope!_
3. *The cat isn't worried, it's excited for the oppourtunity to learn!* _taking every challenge life throws your way as an oppourtunity for growth!_
