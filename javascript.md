# Programming with Javascript
## Introduction
This chapter explains how javascript is used to make websites more interactive within a browser. there are four basic ways that it acomplishes this feat:
1. Accesses Content from your structure by selecting any element that has a class atribute
2. Modifies Content by adding elements, attributes and text to your page.  Even removing them if you desire.
3. Programming Rules to set step by step instructions for the browser to follow like a recipie, which allows you to access or change content on your webpage.
4. React to Events by creating a specific script that runs when a specific event occurs on your webpage, telling the browser to change or modify content.

### What is a Script?
A Script is a series of instructions that your computer will follow in order to achieve a goal you want the computer to achieve.
> The chapter reminds the reader that it is important to know that computers take instruction very differently than people do.  while people can assume that other people have some baseline knowledge of the world around them, it is easier to explain how to make a pb&j.  
> If you were to tell a computer how to make a pb&j, it would need to be broken down programmatically in order for the computer to perform the task correctly.  This would have to be performed every time, because no matter how many times a computer makes a pb&j, it will be like making it the first time all over again.

### Writing a Script
1. Define the task you want to achieve, as if it were a puzzle for the computer to solve for the first time.
2. Design a script that is split up into a series of tasks in order to solve the puzzle.  they recommend that you use a flow chart to structure out your ideas before you begin writing the script.
3. Each step of the way has to be coded in the language that the computer understands.

## Expressions and Operators
An expression results in a single value, there are two types of values:
1. Just assign a value to a variable
> `var color = 'beige';`  the value of the variable is "beige"
2. Use two or more values to return a single value
> `var area = 3 * 2;` the value of the area is "6"

Expressions rely on things called operators.  These allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.  There are many different types of operators:
> Assignment Operators assign a value to a variable `color = 'beige';`
> Arithmetic Operators perform basic math `area = 3 * 2;`
> String Operators combine two strings `greeting = 'Hi' + 'There!';`

You can not perform arithmetic when using string operators and assignment operators are the most basic form of operator.

### Arithmetic Operators

Name | Operator | Purpose
-----|----------|--------
Addition | + | Adds one value to another
Subtraction | - | Subtracts one value from another
Division | / | Divides two values
Multiplication | * | Multiplies two values using an asterisk
Increment | ++ | Adds one to the current number
Decrement | -- | Subtracts one from the current number
Modulus | % | Divides two values and returns the remainder

## Functions
I could read this chapter a hundred times and still not fully understand these concepts.  A function lets you group a series of statements together to perform a task as many times as you'd like without having to type out each statement within a function repeatedly.  you could have a long sequence that performs as a function, but as long as the function exists, all you would need to do in order to perform that function would be to call the function in your code.  example `basicFunction();` is all you would need to type in your code after you established the function.
